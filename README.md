# ai-task-scaffold

Local-first PowerShell tooling for deterministic multi-repository task workspaces.

## Target workspace layout

```text
<workspace-root>/
  task-scaffold.settings.json
  canons/<repo>/
  tasks/<TASK-KEY>/
    task.json
    PRD.md
    PLAN.md
    STATUS.md
    artifacts/
    worktrees/<repo>/
```

`canons/` contains clean, shared base clones on their configured target branches. Task changes happen only in `tasks/<TASK-KEY>/worktrees/<repo>/`.

## Commands

- `scripts/Invoke-TaskScaffold.ps1` — validate a request, produce a deterministic plan, then create/reuse task state and worktrees only with `-Apply`.
- `scripts/Invoke-TaskTeardown.ps1` — plan or, only with `-Apply`, remove clean registered task worktrees and their task directory; it leaves branches and canons intact.
- `scripts/Update-WorkspaceFolders.ps1` — separately propose or SHA-gated apply add-only VS Code workspace entries.

The repository is local-only; it intentionally has no remote. Run the offline suite with:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-Pester -Path ./tests -Output Detailed"
```
